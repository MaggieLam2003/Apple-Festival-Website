        <h3>
            Alley Cat Cafe
        </h3>
        <p>
            Alley Cat Cafe opened in June and serves freshly prepared plant-based and gluten-free baked goods, soups, and sandwiches along with freshly brewed and cold beverages. Though the vegan and vegetarian food options are is enjoyed by many, the cafe quickly gained popularity in the community for one of its non-food and beverage offerings, the kitty and cat playrooms situated in the rear of the establishment. It's the first restaurant in the Ithaca area to offer this combination.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Alley Cat Café is located near the corner of Laurel Street and College Avenue, across the street from Colorado State University. To find the cafe, walk along Laurel Street and turn down Dalzell Alley, which is between the Ras-Ka restaurant and Laurel Street Emporium. The Alley Cat Café is located on the second floor. There are the two entrances: the first is a stairway located outside and the second is through the ground floor of Dam Good Tacos.
