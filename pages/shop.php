            The Farmers Market is a staple of the Ithaca community. Similar to the Harvest Festival, many local vendors and creators come together to provide their creations to the Ithaca community. Many people come from the surrounding area to visit this market, and you can buy almost anything you want! The best part is they are open almost year round (except for those awfully cold winter months), so you can come back anytime to check it out.
