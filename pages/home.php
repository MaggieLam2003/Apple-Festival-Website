                Fun Facts
            </h2>
            <p>
                Ithaca's Apple Festival prides itself in having some of the best quality apples in the nation. Apples are carefully tended to since the they were grown. All apples are rinsed with Fuji water in order to ensure maximum quality. These apples are then transported to Downtown Ithaca via government jets with an army escort. This is to provide locals with the freshest and best quality apples.
